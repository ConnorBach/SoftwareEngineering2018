The OceanExplorer class does most of the heavy lifting, holding instances 
of the ships, pirate ships, and ocean map. It handles all the animation by
checking the key press event and updating the location of the images.

Each ship and pirate ship has a position and the ability to move. The ship
moves based on key presses and the pirate ships "chase" the ship. Each
pirate ship is registered as an observer of the actual ship so they have
a constantly updated location for the ship.

Every object has an instance of the ocean map, so they can check for
collisions with islands and avoid them.

To implement the stretch part of the assignment I would keep the islands
in the same place. Then I would reset the positions of the ship and pirate
ships by calling set position methods for each and passing random numbers
until they find an empty square to occupy. Since the OceanExplorer class
gets all of its position information from the ship classes, you only need
to update the positions in those classes.
