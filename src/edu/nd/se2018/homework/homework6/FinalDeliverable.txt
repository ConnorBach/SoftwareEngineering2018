Overall my design incorporates several features. It draws the 25x25 game board and moves Chip around the terrain.
Chip can be controlled by the arrow keys and the game exits when the ESC key is pressed. Additionally, each level randomly
generates lava squares that Chip cannot pass through. The second level adds additional lava squares, increasing the difficulty.
Chip can advance levels by reaching one of the portals on the map. There is also a blue key that is placed on the map. When
Chip picks up one of the keys the lava is transformed into harmless water, allowing Chip to travel across the map with ease.

This project has three major classes: Chip.java, ChipMap.java, and ChipsChallenge.java. The main class is ChipsChallenge,
which sets up the levels and contains the logic for handling key events. It holds an instance of Chip and ChipMap. Chip
holds the logic for handling movement and item behaviour. Chip's movement ability is modified by the hasItem condition.
The ChipMap holds the information about the lava, portals, and water. It has methods to add lava and switch to water when an
item is picked up.

Overall I like how my design came together. It was fairly easy to manage interactions between Chip, the map, and the game loop.
I had considered making another class for the lava but managing it in the map turned out to be simpler. Similarly, the item
did not have enough complexity to warrant it's own class, making it easier to integrate it into the Chip class.
